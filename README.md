## Description
The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on practice with working with the basics of PHP by creating and XKCD Password Generator.  This is a different approach for creating passwords.  Rather than using combinations of letters, numbers and symbols that are difficult to remember (which is why most people write down their password) the XKCD model is one that uses whole words in a sequence.  These are easier to remember and more difficult to crack.

## Demo
A demo and presentation will be provided an the next in-person section meeting.
